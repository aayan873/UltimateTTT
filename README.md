# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Bot Engine

## About this Repository

This repository contains the game engine and setup for a coding competition based on **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**.

Your job is simple: build a bot that plays smart and tries to win.  
The game logic is already written — you just have to code the brain behind the moves.
