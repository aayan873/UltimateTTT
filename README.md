## üéÆ Game Overview

**Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe** is played on a 9√ó9 grid, subdivided into nine 3√ó3 local boards (the global board). Each move in a cell determines where the opponent must play next. The goal is to win three local boards in a row ‚Äî just like regular Tic-Tac-Toe, but on a grander scale.

- The board is represented as a 9√ó9 matrix.
- A move is a `(row, col)` tuple (0-indexed).
- Winning a local board earns you a cell on the global board.
- If a local board is already won or full, the next player can choose any available cell on any valid board.

## Goal of the Competition
Create the best bot that can beat other bots in Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe.


## üìÇ How Bots Work

Each bot is a Python file inside the `bots/` directory, and must implement the following function:

```python
def play(board, prev_move, player):
    # board: 9x9 current board state
    # prev_move: (row, col) of the last move played
    # player: 1 or 2 (you are given your ID)
    # Return: (row, col) of your move
    ...
